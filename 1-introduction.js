    => JavaScript History
    JavaScript has a rich history that dates back to its creation by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. Originally named "LiveScript," it was later renamed JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time. JavaScript was primarily designed to add interactivity to web pages and quickly became a vital component of web development. In 1997, it was standardized as ECMAScript, ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, with the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) bringing major enhancements to the language. Today, JavaScript is a cornerstone of web development, powering everything from complex web applications to server-side scripting and even mobile app development through frameworks like Node.js and React Native.
