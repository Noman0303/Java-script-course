/**
    The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

/**
    => JavaScript Identifiers (Variables Name)
    All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
    These unique names are called identifiers.

    Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

    The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

    1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
    2. Names must begin with a letter.
    3. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
    4. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
    5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
 */

// 1. Variable can not be any keywords

// https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp

// 2. Variable name has to be in one word, can't use space
// 3. Variable name can not have quotation
// 4. Variable name can not starts with number
// 5. How to declare variable properly

//camel Case
const UserName = "Rahim";
const user_Name = "Rahim";
const user_name = "Rahim";
const userName = "Rahim";
